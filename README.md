# Solari TIKA (TARIMSAL ƒ∞NSANSIZ KARA ARACI) Ground Control Station V1.0

**Solari TIKA GCS** is a GUI for using TEKNOFEST TIKA, developed by Rolesa.

---

**WARNING:** Due to optimization issues, it is recommended to use V1.0 in Windows light mode. It is anticipated that this issue will be resolved in future versions.

The **SOLARI** ground station works together with the Raspberry Pi, STM32, and Pixhawk present in the TIKA vehicle. The Raspberry Pi and SOLARI ground station must be on the same Wi-Fi network, and their IP addresses need to be adjusted accordingly. Valid tabs in the control station: **Camera**, **Waypoint Saving**, **Home**, and others are not in use.

## Waypoint Saving:

- **Get GPS:** Used to retrieve the current GPS location of the vehicle.
- **Send Waypoints Button:** Used to save the GPS locations obtained from the manual coordinate entry section or from the Get GPS button as waypoints.
- **Waypoints for Hoe Lift:** This section is used to lift the hoe controlled by the STM positioned on the vehicle at the specified waypoints.
- **Waypoints for Hoe Drop:** This section is used to drop the hoe controlled by the STM positioned on the vehicle at the specified waypoints.
- **Send Mission:** Assigns the task of lifting and dropping the hoe at the specified waypoints.

## Camera:

- **Start:** Begins receiving and processing images from the IP address where the stream is being broadcast.
- **Stop-Close (Performs the same function):** Stops receiving and processing the stream.
- **Last Location:** Displays the approximate GPS location produced by estimating the position of the detected object (the plant) at a specified distance from the vehicle.
- **Detection Count:** Non-functional.

## Home:

- **Tasks-Status Information (Loadcell data, Connection status):** Some are undefined.
- **Mavlink:** Specifies which port will be used for the MAVLink connection with Pixhawk.
- **Connect Button:** Initiates the MAVLink connection from the specified port.
- **Hoe Lift-Drop:** Added to test the movement of the hoe positioned on the vehicle. Used for the manual up-down movement of the hoe.
- **Start-HOLD-MANUAL-FORCE_ARM-DISARM Buttons:** Used to switch the vehicle between AUTO-HOLD-MANUAL modes and to arm and disarm.
